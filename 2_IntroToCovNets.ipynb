    "## 1.0 Introduction to convolutional neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson introduces you to a powerful neural network architecture, known as **convolutional neural networks**. Convolutional neural networks operate by **learning a set of filters**  or **convolution kernels**. Using a process, known as **convolution**, these filters extract a **feature map** from the raw data. The feature map is a **lower dimensional** map of the raw input features. This map is learned in a supervised machine learning process employing back propagation. You can think of convolutional neural networks as a powerful and flexible **dimensionality reduction** method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are used to build feature maps from any type of data with coherency in one or more dimensions. This includes time series data, and text data as one dimensional cases, and image data as a two dimensional case. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks have a resonably long history. The first known commerical application was for automated processing of check images by LeCun et. al. (1998). For unclear reasons, convolutional neural networks were religated to specialized applications such as hand writing recognition until Krizhevsky et. al. (2012) used them to deciscively win an ImageNet object recognition competition. Curiously, other teams had previously used convolutional neural networks to win competitons, but somehow this was not widely recognized. \n",

    "> **Exercise 2-2:** You will now use Keras to define the CovNet model named `nn`. This model uses both convolutional layers and max pooling layers. You can find [documentation on the convolutional layers in the Keras documentation](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/). You can find [documentaton on pooling layers in the Keras documentation](https://keras.io/layers/pooling/).\n",
    "> The architecture of the model you will create is:\n",
    "> 1. A 3X3 convolutional layer with 32 output channels using the [Conv2D](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2D/) function, with `activation='relu'`. Recall that this operation creates a feature map with 32 channels from the single gray-scale input channel. Make sure you define the input shape. \n",

    "> 7. A Dense (fully-connected) hidden layer with 64 units is the first classifier layer, with `activation='relu'`. A limited amount of regularization is applied using Keras [layer regularizer l2](https://keras.io/api/layers/regularizers/) as a ` kernel_regularizer`, with hyperparameter 0.1. This layer operates on the flattened feature map. \n",

    "## 4.0 Padding convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have observed, each convolution layer in a neural network reduces the spatial dimensions by $\\frac{span+1}{2}$ for odd span kernels. The coverage of the convolution opertor can be expanded by **zero padding** in the spatial dimenstion. With the zero padding added, the convolution operator covers the entire spatial dimension of the input tensor. This type of convolution is sometime referred to as **same convolution**, since the output tensor has the same spatial dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations, adding zero padding produces a better feature map. Zero padding allows each pixel to be visited the same number of times by the convolution operator. Without padding pixels at the edge, are not full represented in the feature map. More importantly, the larger feature map will have bigger model capacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "2-d convolution with zero padding is illustrated in Figure 4.1 below. The original input 2-d input tensor is shown in gray. The span of the kernel is 3X3 so one additional column of zeros is added to each sided along with a row of zeros top and bottom. As illustrated, the kernel can operate on the edge pixels. The result is an output tensor with the same spatial dimension as the input. \n",
